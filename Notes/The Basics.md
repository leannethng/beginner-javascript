# The Basics

## Variable Statements

Const for api keys etc
Not changeable

`‘Use strict’;` enforced by default when using javascript models, but good practice to help ensure variables are defined and set properly.

Scoping in JS - Where are my variables available to me.

Var variable are _function scoped_
let and const are _block scoped_

- Uses _const_ by default, if he needs to change a value of a variable then he changes it to a _let_ so that he can set it to something different in the future, he almost never uses a _var_ variable.

### Naming conventions

- Variables shouldn’t start with a capitalized letter unless they are a class
- Variables must start with a-z or can contain or start with \$ or \_
- \$ for jQuery convention
- \_ for low dash library
- camelCase is good
